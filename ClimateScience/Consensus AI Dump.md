This consensus is supported by extensive peer-reviewed literature and high levels of agreement among climate experts. While public perception of this consensus varies, efforts to communicate it can help align public understanding with the scientific reality.




# CAI on Vulnerabilities:

### Introduction

Climate change is expected to have significant impacts on human health, with various studies projecting increased mortality due to factors such as extreme temperatures, air pollution, and the spread of diseases. Understanding which effects of climate change will have the highest mortality is crucial for developing effective public health strategies and mitigation policies.

### Key Insights

- **Heat-Related Mortality**:
    
    - Heat-related mortality is projected to increase significantly, especially in warmer regions and among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions[1](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-1) [2](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-2) [5](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-5) [7](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-7).
    - In China, heat-related excess mortality is expected to rise from 1.9% in the 2010s to 5.5% in the 2090s under high-emission scenarios[2](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-2).
    - In the UK, heat-related deaths could increase by around 257% by the 2050s from a current annual baseline of around 2000 deaths[5](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-5).
- **Cold-Related Mortality**:
    
    - Cold-related mortality is expected to decrease in many regions due to warmer winters, but the overall burden of cold-related deaths may still remain significant, particularly in temperate and cold climates[1](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-1) [5](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-5) [6](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-6) [9](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-9).
- **Air Pollution**:
    
    - Climate change is likely to exacerbate air pollution, leading to increased mortality from ozone and fine particulate matter (PM 2.5). This is expected to result in thousands of additional deaths annually, particularly in regions like India and East Asia[9](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-9) [10](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-10).
- **Vector-Borne Diseases**:
    
    - The spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue is projected to increase due to climate change, contributing to higher mortality rates, especially in tropical and subtropical regions[3](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-3).
- **Extreme Weather Events**:
    
    - Increased frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as tropical storms, are expected to lead to higher mortality rates. For example, storm-related deaths in Mexico could rise by as much as 52% under certain climate change scenarios[4](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-4).
- **Vulnerable Populations**:
    
    - Older adults are particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change, including heat stress, air pollution, and extreme weather events. This demographic is expected to account for the highest proportion of climate change-related mortality[5](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-5) [6](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-6) [7](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20effects%20of%20climate%20change%20will%20have%20the%20highest%20mortality&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-7).

### Conclusion

The effects of climate change that are projected to have the highest mortality include heat-related deaths, exacerbated air pollution, and the spread of vector-borne diseases. Vulnerable populations, particularly the elderly, are at the greatest risk. Mitigation strategies to limit global warming and targeted public health interventions are essential to reduce these health risks.



# GHG Emissions and Health

### Impacts of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions on Human Health

Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have far-reaching impacts on human health, primarily through their contribution to climate change and the resulting environmental and health hazards. The following synthesis presents key insights from multiple research papers on this topic.

#### Key Insights

- **Increased Disease Burden and Disability-Adjusted Life Years (DALYs)**
    
    - GHG emissions contribute to a significant increase in disease burden, measured in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), due to factors such as malnutrition, extreme weather events, and vector-borne diseases[1](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20impacts%20do%20GHG%20emission%20have%20on%20human%20health&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-1) [3](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20impacts%20do%20GHG%20emission%20have%20on%20human%20health&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-3) [7](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20impacts%20do%20GHG%20emission%20have%20on%20human%20health&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-7).
    - In the United States, healthcare sector emissions alone are projected to cause between 123,000 to 381,000 DALYs annually[1](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20impacts%20do%20GHG%20emission%20have%20on%20human%20health&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-1).
    - In Canada, healthcare-associated emissions are linked to a median estimate of 23,000 DALYs lost annually[8](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20impacts%20do%20GHG%20emission%20have%20on%20human%20health&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-8).
- **Reduction in Life Expectancy**
    
    - In Nigeria, a 1% increase in GHG emissions is associated with a 0.0422% reduction in life expectancy, indicating a direct negative impact on health outcomes[2](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20impacts%20do%20GHG%20emission%20have%20on%20human%20health&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-2).
- **Respiratory and Allergic Conditions**
    
    - GHG emissions exacerbate air pollution, which in turn worsens respiratory health, increases the frequency and severity of asthma and allergic rhinitis, and promotes susceptibility to infections[4](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20impacts%20do%20GHG%20emission%20have%20on%20human%20health&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-4).
- **Multiple Climate Hazards**
    
    - GHG emissions intensify multiple climate hazards such as heatwaves, floods, droughts, and storms, which collectively pose a broad threat to human health and safety[5](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20impacts%20do%20GHG%20emission%20have%20on%20human%20health&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-5).
- **Nutritional and Health Outcomes from Dietary Changes**
    
    - Shifting to sustainable dietary patterns can reduce GHG emissions and provide modest health benefits, including reduced all-cause mortality risk[6](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20impacts%20do%20GHG%20emission%20have%20on%20human%20health&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-6).
    - However, diets with lower GHG emissions may not always result in better nutritional quality or health outcomes, as they can be high in sugar and low in essential micronutrients[10](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20impacts%20do%20GHG%20emission%20have%20on%20human%20health&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-10).
- **Co-benefits of GHG Mitigation**
    
    - Reducing GHG emissions can also reduce co-emitted air pollutants, leading to significant co-benefits for air quality and human health, including the prevention of millions of premature deaths globally by 2100[9](https://consensus.app/results/?q=What%20impacts%20do%20GHG%20emission%20have%20on%20human%20health&synthesize=on&copilot=on#result-9).

#### Conclusion

GHG emissions have a profound and multifaceted impact on human health, contributing to increased disease burden, reduced life expectancy, and exacerbated respiratory and allergic conditions. The intensification of multiple climate hazards further compounds these health risks. While dietary changes and GHG mitigation efforts can offer health co-benefits, it is crucial to ensure that such measures also address potential nutritional deficiencies. Overall, reducing GHG emissions is essential for protecting public health and mitigating the adverse effects of climate change.
