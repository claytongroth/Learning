"Climate change and human health: present and future risks","Climate change will negatively impact human health, primarily through thermal stress, extreme weather events, and infectious diseases, but also through social, demographic, and economic disruptions.","A. Mcmichael, R. Woodruff, S. Hales",2006,2239,"There is near unanimous scientific consensus that greenhouse gas emissions generated by human activity will change Earth's climate. The recent (globally averaged) warming by 0.5 degrees C is partly attributable to such anthropogenic emissions. Climate change will affect human health in many ways-mostly adversely. Here, we summarise the epidemiological evidence of how climate variations and trends affect various health outcomes. We assess the little evidence there is that recent global warming has already affected some health outcomes. We review the published estimates of future health effects of climate change over coming decades. Research so far has mostly focused on thermal stress, extreme weather events, and infectious diseases, with some attention to estimates of future regional food yields and hunger prevalence. An emerging broader approach addresses a wider spectrum of health risks due to the social, demographic, and economic disruptions of climate change. Evidence and anticipation of adverse health effects will strengthen the case for pre-emptive policies, and will also guide priorities for planned adaptive strategies.","literature review","The Lancet","1","10.1016/S0140-6736(06)68079-3","https://consensus.app/papers/climate-change-health-future-risks-mcmichael/e3e461e7139e55fca645085ff1982437/"
"Climate change and human health: recognising the really inconvenient truth","Climate change is weakening Earth's life-support systems, and if not reversed, it portends a disastrous outcome, with adverse impacts on human health expected to rise over coming decades.","Anthony J. McMichael, Colin D. Butler",2009,359,"3–4° C. 1-3 Most political institutions have short-term priorities. These impede the urgent, enlightened and unselfish collective action needed to respond to this unprecedented global environmental challenge. 3,4 Despite the rapid maturation of climate change science and the wonders of global sensing technology and electronic connectivity, we collectively fail to understand the full extent of the risks we face. Something fundamental is missing. Preoccupation with the technical details of climate change science, and with economic costs, property protection and the politics of shared responsibility, has overshadowed full appreciation of the consequences for human health and survival. Despite the growing recognition of the risks posed by climate change to social and economic wellbeing, the risks to human health are mostly viewed as regrettable, and hopefully tolerable, collateral damage. This view is very naive. It fails to recognise the profound significance of the risks posed to the biology and health of plant and animal species everywhere, including our species. Christmas joys aside, this situation signals a Red Alert. Climate change is weakening Earth’s life-support systems, and, if not reversed, portends a disastrous outcome. This is no longer a matter of speculation or theoretical modelling. The number of people affected annually by heatwaves and other extreme weather events has risen in several countries over recent decades. For example, the average annual number of excess deaths associated with heatwaves has increased markedly over the past two decades in Hungary, commensurate with a threefold increase in the average annual frequency of heatwaves. 5 Food yields have recently decreased in some regions, including parts of Asia, southern Africa and the eastern Sahelian region of Africa, in association with a range of environmental stresses that include warming, drying and severe flooding. 6 Some infectious diseases have changed their geographic range and seasonal duration, in association with regional warming. This includes northward extensions in Sweden of tick-borne encephalitis and its tick vector, and in China of the critical winter survival zone for water snails that transmit schistosomiasis. Similarly, malaria has been occurring at higher altitudes in highland regions in parts of eastern Africa. 7 Despite current evidence, such as the marked ecosystem changes and accelerated ice losses in the Arctic, human-driven climate change is still at an early stage; excessive greenhouse gas emissions will continue for (at least) decades, and the full realisation of their effect on climate will be drawn out over time. 8 The momentum of change in the climate system is huge and protracted, especially for sea level rise. Hence, most current climate “mitigation” actions will have limited immediate effect, and further delay and attenuation of emission reduction targets by governments will invite disaster. Adverse impacts on human health can be expected to rise over coming decades — particularly in vulnerable populations in low-income and poorly resourced countries, such as Bhutan and Nepal, and in geographically exposed locations, such as river delta populations, and small island states, and south-eastern Australia. Meanwhile, the unequivocal detection of climate-related health impacts at this early stage presents a research challenge. The health effects of climate change coincide with various non-climate-related causal factors — so, for example, an upwards trend in excess deaths during heatwaves may also be due to population ageing and a greater prevalence of underlying cardiovascular disease. Further, human vulnerability (unlike that of all other species) is typically cushioned by culture, technology, trade and aid. However, this difference in vulnerability between Homo sapiens and other living organisms is less than we might imagine. The natural environment, the biosphere, furnishes all of Nature’s processes and the products upon which our health and survival depend: food, fresh water and fibre (including timber, firewood and cotton), natural constraints on pathogens, access to natural medicines and a relatively stable climate. These things, rather than hospitals, doctors, genetic testing and dietary advice, are the true foundations of population health. Climate risks to health are both direct and indirect. Direct risks include deaths and physical injury from extreme events, such as increasingly frequent and intense bushfires, cyclones and floods; and deaths and hospitalisations from extreme heat. Indirect risks include changes in the range and seasonality of various infectious diseases, and impaired food system productivity on both land and sea, productivity in the latter being compounded by oceanic acidification due to greater uptake of carbon dioxide. Mental and physical health problems can result from the social disruption and dislocation caused by weather extremes that are bringing drought and long-term regional drying out to parts of rural Australia. A likely increase in the flow of climate refugees, here and elsewhere, will also have consequences for health and health care systems. Climate change will act primarily by amplifying and extending the rates and ranges of existing health problems. Hence, to minimise climate change impacts, it is crucial to reduce the high background rates of poor health in vulnerable populations. Many low-income countries are already struggling to meet the UN’s","","Medical Journal of Australia","1","10.5694/j.1326-5377.2009.tb03342.x","https://consensus.app/papers/climate-change-health-recognising-really-truth-mcmichael/6e489cfff6445d70967cc01e227ab454/"
"Public Perceptions of Climate Change as a Human Health Risk: Surveys of the United States, Canada and Malta","Majority of people in the US, Canada, and Malta believe climate change poses significant health risks, with a majority believing it already harms people's health, with a focus on respiratory, heat-related, cancer, and infectious diseases.","K. Akerlof, Roberto Debono, P. Berry, A. Leiserowitz, C. Roser-Renouf, Kaila-Lea Clarke, A. Rogaeva, M. Nisbet, Melinda R. Weathers, E. Maibach",2010,146,"We used data from nationally representative surveys conducted in the United States, Canada and Malta between 2008 and 2009 to answer three questions: Does the public believe that climate change poses human health risks, and if so, are they seen as current or future risks? Whose health does the public think will be harmed? In what specific ways does the public believe climate change will harm human health? When asked directly about the potential impacts of climate change on health and well-being, a majority of people in all three nations said that it poses significant risks; moreover, about one third of Americans, one half of Canadians, and two-thirds of Maltese said that people are already being harmed. About a third or more of people in the United States and Canada saw themselves (United States, 32%; Canada, 67%), their family (United States, 35%; Canada, 46%), and people in their community (United States, 39%; Canada, 76%) as being vulnerable to at least moderate harm from climate change. About one third of Maltese (31%) said they were most concerned about the risk to themselves and their families. Many Canadians said that the elderly (45%) and children (33%) are at heightened risk of harm, while Americans were more likely to see people in developing countries as being at risk than people in their own nation. When prompted, large numbers of Canadians and Maltese said that climate change can cause respiratory problems (78–91%), heat-related problems (75–84%), cancer (61–90%), and infectious diseases (49–62%). Canadians also named sunburn (79%) and injuries from extreme weather events (73%), and Maltese cited allergies (84%). However, climate change appears to lack salience as a health issue in all three countries: relatively few people answered open-ended questions in a manner that indicated clear top-of-mind associations between climate change and human health risks. We recommend mounting public health communication initiatives that increase the salience of the human health consequences associated with climate change.","non-rct observational study","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","1","10.3390/ijerph7062559","https://consensus.app/papers/perceptions-climate-change-human-health-risk-surveys-akerlof/2a96ffdd129e5ac49594538a337137ba/"
"Impact of regional climate change on human health","Climate-health relationships pose increasing health risks, with warming trends already contributing to increased morbidity and mortality in various regions.","J. Patz, D. Campbell-Lendrum, T. Holloway, J. Foley",2005,2649,"The World Health Organisation estimates that the warming and precipitation trends due to anthropogenic climate change of the past 30 years already claim over 150,000 lives annually. Many prevalent human diseases are linked to climate fluctuations, from cardiovascular mortality and respiratory illnesses due to heatwaves, to altered transmission of infectious diseases and malnutrition from crop failures. Uncertainty remains in attributing the expansion or resurgence of diseases to climate change, owing to lack of long-term, high-quality data sets as well as the large influence of socio-economic factors and changes in immunity and drug resistance. Here we review the growing evidence that climate–health relationships pose increasing health risks under future projections of climate change and that the warming trend over recent decades has already contributed to increased morbidity and mortality in many regions of the world. Potentially vulnerable regions include the temperate latitudes, which are projected to warm disproportionately, the regions around the Pacific and Indian oceans that are currently subjected to large rainfall variability due to the El Niño/Southern Oscillation sub-Saharan Africa and sprawling cities where the urban heat island effect could intensify extreme climatic events.","","Nature","1","10.1038/nature04188","https://consensus.app/papers/impact-climate-change-health-patz/c3d9df944495533ba5cca2c2b39df276/"
"Vulnerable Populations Perceive Their Health as at Risk from Climate Change","Vulnerable populations, such as those with medical conditions, low income, racial/ethnic minorities, and floodplain residence, already perceive their health as at risk from climate change.","K. Akerlof, P. Delamater, Caroline Boules, C. Upperman, Clifford S. Mitchell",2015,67,"Climate change is already taking a toll on human health, a toll that is likely to increase in coming decades. The relationship between risk perceptions and vulnerability to climate change’s health threats has received little attention, even though an understanding of the dynamics of adaptation among particularly susceptible populations is becoming increasingly important. We demonstrate that some people whose health will suffer the greatest harms from climate change—due to social vulnerability, health susceptibility, and exposure to hazards—already feel they are at risk. In a 2013 survey we measured Maryland residents’ climate beliefs, health risk perceptions, and household social vulnerability characteristics, including medical conditions (n = 2126). We paired survey responses with secondary data sources for residence in a floodplain and/or urban heat island to predict perceptions of personal and household climate health risk. General health risk perceptions, political ideology, and climate beliefs are the strongest predictors. Yet, people in households with the following characteristics also see themselves at higher risk: members with one or more medical conditions or disabilities; low income; racial/ethnic minorities; and residence in a floodplain. In light of these results, climate health communication among vulnerable populations should emphasize protective actions instead of risk messages.","non-rct observational study","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","1","10.3390/ijerph121214994","https://consensus.app/papers/populations-perceive-their-health-risk-climate-change-akerlof/3e628db04d5f5629bb21ee2a8d421482/"
"Preventing and mitigating health risks of climate change.","Climate change poses significant health risks, and mitigation and adaptation strategies can help minimize these risks and adapt to emerging challenges.","Shilu Tong, K. Ebi",2019,110,"Global environmental changes, driven by the consequences of human activities and population growth, are altering our planet in ways that pose current threats to human health, with the magnitude of these threats projected to increase over coming decades if additional, proactive actions are not taken. Global changes, unprecedented in their geospatial and temporal scales, include climate change, marine pollution, ozone layer depletion, soil degradation, and urbanization. Climate change is the best studied. The health risks of a changing climate will become increasingly urgent as climate change affects the quantity and quality of food and water, increases air pollution, alters the distribution of vectors/pathogens and disease transmission dynamics, and reduces eco-physical buffering against extreme weather and climate events. Health systems urgently need to be improved to effectively address these emerging challenges. This paper provides an overview of the health consequences of climate change, and discusses how health risks can be minimized and avoided via mitigation and adaptation pathways.","","Environmental research","1","10.1016/j.envres.2019.04.012","https://consensus.app/papers/preventing-mitigating-health-risks-climate-change-tong/0a96a3a341e256ce9f6ef6dfec2d69d3/"
"Health Risks Due To Climate Change: Inequity In Causes And Consequences.","Climate change is increasing health risks, causing more injuries, illnesses, and deaths, with uneven distribution and exacerbate existing inequities.","K. Ebi, J. Hess",2020,68,"Climate change has altered global to local weather patterns and increased sea levels, and it will continue to do so. Average temperatures, precipitation amounts, and other variables such as humidity levels are all rising. In addition, weather variability is increasing, causing, for example, a greater number of heat waves, many of which are more intense and last longer, and more floods and droughts. These changes are collectively increasing the number of injuries, illnesses, and deaths from a wide range of climate-sensitive health outcomes. Future health risks will be determined not just by the hazards created by a changing climate but also by the sensitivity of individuals and communities exposed to these hazards and the capacity of health systems to prepare for and effectively manage the attendant risks. These risks include deaths and injuries from extreme events (for example, heat waves, storms, and floods), infectious diseases (including food-, water-, and vectorborne illnesses), and food and water insecurity. These risks are unevenly distributed and both create new inequities and exacerbate those that already exist. Most of these risks are projected to increase with each additional unit of warming. Using an equity lens to move beyond incremental to transformational resilience would reduce vulnerability and improve sustainability for all, but substantial additional funding is required for proactive and effective actions by the health system.","","Health affairs","1","10.1377/hlthaff.2020.01125","https://consensus.app/papers/health-risks-climate-change-inequity-causes-consequences-ebi/19baa754e419570c985ccde74e2b7c7d/"
"Is climate change the number one threat to humanity?","Global warming is not the number one threat to humanity, as other health risks and lowered economic development pose greater threats.","I. Goklany",2012,18,"This paper challenges claims that global warming outranks other threats facing humanity through the foreseeable future (assumed to be 2085–2100). World Health Organization and British government‐sponsored global impact studies indicate that, relative to other factors, global warming's impact on key determinants of human and environmental well‐being should be small through 2085 even under the warmest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenario. Specifically, over 20 other health risks currently contribute more to death and disease worldwide than global warming. Through 2085, only 13% of mortality from hunger, malaria, and extreme weather events (including coastal flooding from sea level rise) should be from warming. Moreover, warming should reduce future global population at risk of water stress, and pressures on ecosystems and biodiversity (by increasing net biome productivity and decreasing habitat conversion). That warming is not fundamental to human well‐being is reinforced by lower bound estimates of net gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. This measure adjusts GDP downward to account for damages from warming due to market, health, and environmental impacts, and risk of catastrophe. For both developing and industrialized countries, net GDP per capita—albeit an imperfect surrogate for human well‐being—should be (1) double the current US level by 2100 under the warmest scenario, and (2) lowest under the poorest IPCC scenario but highest under the warmest scenario through 2200. The warmest world, being wealthier, should also have greater capacity to address any problem, including warming. Therefore, other problems and, specifically, lowered economic development are greater threats to humanity than global warming.

"Climate Change, Health and Existential Risks to Civilization: A Comprehensive Review (1989–2013)","Climate change poses significant health risks, but the most severe and existential risks remain under-recognized, with most papers focusing on infectious diseases, direct heat effects, and disciplinary-bounded phenomena.","C. Butler",2018,117,"Background: Anthropogenic global warming, interacting with social and other environmental determinants, constitutes a profound health risk. This paper reports a comprehensive literature review for 1989–2013 (inclusive), the first 25 years in which this topic appeared in scientific journals. It explores the extent to which articles have identified potentially catastrophic, civilization-endangering health risks associated with climate change. Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar were primarily used to identify articles which were then ranked on a three-point scale. Each score reflected the extent to which papers discussed global systemic risk. Citations were also analyzed. Results: Of 2143 analyzed papers 1546 (72%) were scored as one. Their citations (165,133) were 82% of the total. The proportion of annual papers scored as three was initially high, as were their citations but declined to almost zero by 1996, before rising slightly from 2006. Conclusions: The enormous expansion of the literature appropriately reflects increased understanding of the importance of climate change to global health. However, recognition of the most severe, existential, health risks from climate change was generally low. Most papers instead focused on infectious diseases, direct heat effects and other disciplinary-bounded phenomena and consequences, even though scientific advances have long called for more inter-disciplinary collaboration.","systematic review","International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health","1","10.3390/ijerph15102266","https://consensus.app/papers/climate-change-health-existential-risks-civilization-butler/a2b2b6deba9f55928c4499050eb5e676/"
"Climate change and human health: Risks and responses","Climate change poses significant health risks, and public health strategies must address its impacts and vulnerabilities through multisectoral collaboration and adaptation actions.","Shuang Zhong, Cunrui Huang",2019,30,"Climate change is one of the biggest global health threats of the 21st century. Sensitive to shifts in weather and climate patterns, all human populations are affected by the direct and indirect health impacts of climate change. These impacts include exposure to extreme weather events, environmental and ecological disruptions, and even the social responses to climate change and variability. Some groups may be more vulnerable than others due to their high levels of exposure and sensitivity, poverty, and the weaknesses of public health systems in their region. Because climate change is complex and place-specific, vulnerable populations experience health challenges for different reasons. Some factors act as generic causes of vulnerability, such as age, gender, education, current health status, geographic location and environment, physical infrastructure and socioeconomic condition. Given the severity of these risks, the health effects of rapidly changing climate are commanding greater policy attention and government action. A public health response to climate change refers to any short- or long-term strategies that can reduce adverse health impacts or enhance resilience to observed or expected changes in climate and associated extremes. Generally, it operates on two levels: Building climate resilience and implementing adaptation actions. However, any public health response must first overcome the uncertainties of future climate and socioeconomic conditions as well as financial constraints, institutional arrangements, and individual cognitive limits. The current research on climate change and human health shows the scientific community is deepening our understanding the possible health effects and risks of our changing climate. In China, multisectoral and multidisciplinary responses to address the health impacts of climate change are necessary. This will require the close collaboration of individuals, communities, governments, and the research community. In particular, key research projects and methods will need to be developed. First, the regional health risks of climate change should be estimated with a focus on how the geographic range and disease burdens will change with changing weather patterns. Second, the thresholds and the time of emergence of dangerous health consequences caused by climate change should be calculated. Third, a method of detecting and attributing the health effects caused by climate change and variability should be adopted. Fourth, a forecast of how climate change may affect the functioning of health systems and infrastructure should be envisioned. And finally, a method for integrating the uneven patterns of climate change into adaptation planning. The international community has begun addressing some of these issues. Launched at the UN conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20) in 2012, Future Earth is an international research programme that will develop comprehensive knowledge for responding to challenges posed by global environmental change and create transformative opportunities toward global sustainability. The Chinese National Committee for Future Earth (CNC-FE) should make full use of international resources and facilitate collaboration between domestic health sectors and meteorological departments. The governments response should include estimating the health implications of mitigation and adaptation measures when designing government policies, conducting climate change and health impact, vulnerability and adaptation assessments, tracking the progress of health and climate change, identifying opportunities to address the adaptation gap in the nations public health sector, and finally, building climate resilience into Chinas health systems.","","Chinese Science Bulletin","","10.1360/N972018-00898","https://consensus.app/papers/climate-change-health-risks-responses-zhong/81ebbd7a1ffb5161bf3adfe6b3858acb/"
