# TLDR Conclusions

- Main Points:
	- Anthropogenic Climate Change is real ( see evidence section )
	- Anthropogenic Climate Change Consensus is real ( see consensus section )
	- We should act to slow GHG Emissions ( see negative externalities section and GHG section )
- Ancillary Points
	- There is a lot of corruption and lack of integrity in climate science but NOT enough to discredit any of the above.
	- Predictions (that we should trust) say that we should start at a minimun preparing.
	- Panic or doomerism is not warranted by credible evidence.
	- The media blows things out of proportion and is often making *false* claims.
	- Extreme events are *predicted* to rise with little controversy, but *most* are questionably attributable *now* to anthropogenic climate change.
	- It is probably incorrect to associate the cost of disasters with climate change (as of now)
		- Except for heat waves
		- Droughts
		- Floods
	- More fossil fuels won’t make the future better #TODO
	- Air Quality is one of the big unequivocal killers: Health impacts from air pollution #TODO
	- Tons of deaths from fossil fuel pollution #TODO

# Scientific Consensus?

- Consensus can also be seen in the[ IPCC reports](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/)
	- By virtue of how IPCC works, its *extremely* unlikely that consensus is fabricated. See section below.

- Multiple independent studies confirm that 90%–100% of publishing climate scientists agree humans are causing recent global warming, aligning with the 97% consensus reported by Cook et al. This consensus correlates with expertise in climate science, while dissenting views often stem from surveys of non-experts or misinterpretation of abstracts that do not explicitly state the cause of global warming.

### Are there Reasons to Doubt Consensus

- Claims *against* consensus tend to focus on the minutiae of one study and flounder at even that.
- Friedman contra Cook? Even if we grant him this one example, there are still loads more consensus metanalyses to contend with that report consensus. 
	- Friedman claims amongst other things that *"This is misleading because according to your own data, only 1.6% of the papers can be said to have come to that conclusion."* Good summary of that argument [here](https://haakonsk.blog/the-97-climate-consensus-lie-what-you-need-to-know/).
	- Reasons *not* to believe that:
		- It's a strawman.
			- The claim: "Cook claims 97% of paper say the GW is *mainly* human caused. Its actually 1.6%"
			- The truth: (can be read right in the abstract) *"Among abstracts expressing a position on AGW, 97.1% endorsed the consensus position that humans are causing global warming. In a second phase of this study, we invited authors to rate their own papers. Compared to abstract ratings, a smaller percentage of self-rated papers expressed no position on AGW (35.5%). Among self-rated papers expressing a position on AGW, 97.2% endorsed the consensus.*"

# IPCC, biased? Incentive for Conspiracy? Corrupt?

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) operates as an authoritative body that evaluates the scientific knowledge surrounding climate change. Established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the IPCC has a secretariat in Geneva and comprises 195 member states, which elect a bureau of scientists to guide its work.

[Can we really trust the IPCC](https://bonpote.com/en/climate-can-we-really-trust-the-ipcc/)?
- Another thing to remember is that **the IPCC does not make concrete recommendations, but rather, presents projections**.
- _“The IPCC is not a scientific organization, but a political organization of the scientist type. They stifle [those who do not agree with them](https://www.contrepoints.org/2012/11/19/104874-climatologie-comment-le-giec-sorganise-pour-etouffer-les-opinions-sceptiques)”_ This is a common criticism. Another common one is that the IPCC is a ‘consensus’ and that to reach said [consensus](https://bonpote.com/en/did-the-scientific-consensus-on-climate-change-reach-100/), compromises must be made. While that is true, as we have just seen, IPCC reports are validated by all the member states, which have very different interests. If you don’t understand that more than a hundred countries are going to have different interests, I can’t really help you anymore…
- Moreover, there is a significant turnover of IPCC authors, as Valérie Masson-Delmotte explained: _“from one report to the next, at least 50% of new authors, sometimes up to 75%, depending on the report”_.

### How the IPCC Works:

- Its not a research organization it is an organization which collects research.

1. **Assessment Cycles**: The IPCC functions on a cycle lasting six to seven years, during which it prepares comprehensive reports based on existing scientific literature.
    
2. **Expert Involvement**: Thousands of scientists and experts from diverse fields volunteer to review relevant publications and contribute to the IPCC reports, which are created through a formal nomination process by governments and observer organizations.
    
3. **Working Groups**: The IPCC has three main working groups focused on different aspects of climate change: the physical science basis, impacts and adaptation, and mitigation strategies.
    
4. **Report Compilation**: The findings are compiled into Assessment Reports aimed at policymakers and the general public. This process is considered the *largest* peer review in the scientific community.
    
5. **Endorsements**: The reports are endorsed by leading climate scientists and member governments, ensuring a consensus-driven approach.

#### WGs
- **Working Group I (WGI)**: Focuses on the physical science basis of climate change. It examines scientific data on climate change, including observations, modeling, and projections of future climate scenarios.
    
- **Working Group II (WGII)**: Deals with impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability. This group assesses the vulnerability of socio-economic and natural systems to climate change, the negative and positive consequences of climate change, and options for adapting to it.
    
- **Working Group III (WGIII)**: Concentrates on the mitigation of climate change. It explores the methods and strategies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks.
    
- **Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI)**: Develops and refines methodologies and guidelines for countries to calculate and report their greenhouse gas emissions and removals.

### Resistance to Bias and Conspiracy:

1. **Comprehensive Review**: The IPCC does **not** conduct its own original research; instead, it synthesizes existing peer-reviewed scientific literature. This method reduces the likelihood of bias since it draws from a broad range of studies and perspectives.
    
2. **Consensus Process**: The endorsement of reports requires consensus among member governments, which necessitates agreement on findings. This collaborative approach minimizes the influence of any single party and enhances credibility.
    
3. **Transparency and Accountability**: The extensive involvement of volunteers from the scientific community and the rigorous peer-review process ensure transparency. Findings are made publicly available, allowing for scrutiny and further discussion.
    
4. **Reputable Backing**: The IPCC has received recognition for its contributions to understanding climate change, including sharing the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize. This widespread acknowledgment adds to its authority and credibility in the field.
    
By employing these methods, the IPCC aims to maintain objectivity and a strong scientific basis, making it less susceptible to bias and conspiracy theories.


# What are the Negative Externalities (Of GHG emissions and AGW)
-  **TL;DR:** Lots of risks related to resource availability, economy, food production and crop yield, deaths due to heat and extreme weather events, non-linear ergodic changes in weather, increased incidence of fires and droughts and increased vectors of disease
- [IPCC Summary for Policy Makers](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_SPM.pdf)
	- Page 22: the steeper the degrees increase in temp, the worse off for:
		- Mortality from heat/humidity
		- Crop yield
		- Fishery yield 
		- Extreme Weather Events
- [Good Summary of WG2](https://bonpote.com/en/33-billion-people-exposed-to-climate-change-the-new-ipcc-report-is-without-appeal/)
- IPCC WG2 SPM Summaries:
	- Near Term Risks
		- **Mid- to long-term climate risks depend on the level of global warming, with impacts potentially multiple times higher than currently observed and escalating with each increment of warming (high confidence)**.
		- **Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation will continue to escalate with global warming, with a significant percentage of species facing a very high risk of extinction depending on the level of warming (very high confidence)**.
		- **Risks related to water availability and water-related hazards will increase, particularly impacting snowmelt-dependent river basins, glacier-fed systems, and groundwater in Small Islands (high confidence)**.
		- **Climate change will increasingly threaten food production and access, especially in vulnerable regions, leading to severe food security risks and malnutrition at higher warming levels (high confidence)**.
		- **Climate change and extreme events will significantly increase ill health and premature deaths globally, with a rise in heat-related mortality and climate-sensitive diseases, particularly dengue, and mental health challenges (high confidence)**.
		- **Climate change risks to cities, settlements, and key infrastructure will rise rapidly, especially in high-temperature, coastal, or highly vulnerable areas, with a billion people projected to be at risk from coastal-specific hazards by the mid-term (high confidence)**.
		- **Projected global economic damages from climate change generally increase non-linearly with warming levels, with higher estimates indicating potentially greater impacts than previously assessed (high confidence)**.
		- **Displacement due to climate change will increase with intensifying heavy precipitation, flooding, tropical cyclones, drought, and sea level rise, with higher warming levels exacerbating vulnerability and affecting violent conflict (high confidence)**.

	- - **Health**
		- Within 2°C: Estimated an average global temperature rise > 1.2°C will increase premature mortality by several hundred thousands, excluding extreme events like heat waves.
		- > 2°C to 2.5°C: A rise of 2.3°C by 2080 puts up to 270 million at risk from malaria (IS92a S>1000).
		- > 3°C: A rise of 3.3°C by 2080 would put up to 330 million at risk from malaria (IS92a unmit).
	- **Ecosystems**
		- Within 2°C: Up to 1°C above preindustrial levels will shift up to 10% of ecosystem areas worldwide.
		- > 2°C to 2.5°C: A rise of 1–2°C above preindustrial levels will shift up to 15–20% of ecosystem areas worldwide.
			
		- > 3°C: A rise of >2°C above pre-industrial levels will likely shift over 20% of ecosystems due to climate change, with global losses of coastal wetlands potentially exceeding 10%.
	- **Agriculture**
		- Within 2°C: The EU (and US) yields increase for up to 2°C temperature rise, but beyond this, decline occurs.
		- > 2°C to 2.5°C: Heat stress likely to affect subtropics/tropics for a 1.7°C temperature increase.
		- > 3°C: Higher average temperatures of 2.5°C in 2080 could result in 50 million additional people at risk of hunger. With a 3°C rise, a group of developing countries with a population of 2 billion will see the food deficit double.
	- **Water**
		- Within 2°C: For many regions under water stress, global mean temperature increases above around 1.5°C lead to decreases in water supply.
		- > 2°C to 2.5°C: Additional people in water shortage regions are estimated to be in the range of 400-800 million for around a 1°C warming.
			
		- > 3°C: Above 2.5°C warming, the risk begins to saturate, with an estimated 3.1-3.5 billion additional persons at risk.
	- **Major Events**
		- Within 2°C: At 1.5°C, onset of complete melting of Greenland Ice will contribute an additional 7m to sea level rise.
		- > 2°C to 2.5°C: There is a risk of major catastrophic events, with potential to trigger melting of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, raising sea levels by an additional 5-6m.
		- > 3°C: The risk of significant major catastrophic events increases, with a probability of thermohaline shutdown up to 50% or above over 4°C.
- [WRI Summary:](https://www.wri.org/insights/2023-ipcc-ar6-synthesis-report-climate-change-findings)
	- increase in GMST is attributable to anthropogenic causes
	- Higher global mean surface temp GMST leads to increase in vectors for disease that kill the most people. e.g. Malaria
	- Biodiversity loss scales non-linearly up with increase in GMST attributable to anthropogenic causes
		- Tipping points for species extinction. Point being we don't really know what that will do.
	- Drought (extreme and unprecedented) effects nonlinearly more people with increase in GMST attributable to anthropogenic causes
	- 40-50% increase in wildfires predicted even at lowest increases in GMST attributable to
	- For lots of these factors, we *can* adapt, but it costs money and lives.
	- Some irreparable damage has already been done
	- The IPCC finds that there is a more than 50% chance that global temperature rise will reach or surpass 1.5 degrees C between 2021 -- 2040 across studied scenarios
	- 1.5C is where things are projected to get much much worse.
	- GHG emissions are modeled to be required to **not** exceed 1.5C
- More Malaria studies:
	- **TLDR**, we are getting better at treating malaria, but climate change makes more disease vectors in temperate climates

- Heat risk
	- **TLDR**: heat will kill more people per year by a large margin than it otherwise would as the frequency of extreme heat events increases and GMST increases. THis would be offset somewhat by a *decrease* in deaths from cold which kills more people actually by about 8-15X.

# What are the Positive Externalities

- **TL;DR:** Obviously AGW is not inherently bad. That would be a stupid position. While there are some positive effects in the short and medium term, the short and medium-term negative outcomes are going to outweigh them. Lots of this has to do with the fact that it is an ergodic process with "tipping points". (That means there are many points, due to the complex interwoven nature of climate, that we pass a point of no return and adaptation becomes the only option. These are not always gradual.)
