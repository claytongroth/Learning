# Roadmap (year)

## Plan
- Foundational crap
	- **BLOCKING**: Terminal https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtqBQ68cfJc
		- Abandon "finder", abandon manually editing files etc.
	- **BLOCKING**: "How does the internet work?"
		- ELI5
	- CS basics 
		- Look this over. Crazy: https://github.com/geohot/fromthetransistor
			- George Hotz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Hlb8YX2-W8&t=735s
		- Passive absorption
		- CS Basics: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zOjov-2OZ0E
	- Git
		- Make a cheatsheet
		- Basic video (good low brain power)
	- `nano` or `vim`
		- get "ok" with one of those
- Challenges -> Git
	- Data structures,
	- Algorithms
- 3-5 Projects That are good. (ground up and *prove it*)
	- 1. Things you built because you wanted them and they are cool.
	- 2. Videos
	- 3. Personal touch
	- Great Example: 
		- https://www.rickvermeil.com/software
	- Dockerize
- Languages:
	- Main Python and/or JS
		- JS safest (Learn Typescript)
		- No excuse not to know Python *scripting*
			- Maaaybe some `shell` scripting
	- Pick a left-field language and put 20% effort there
		- Write a mini project with?
		- The harder the better, the more "lower-level" the better
			- Golang
			- Java
			- C# > C++

## Process
- Plan on ~3 months of ramp-up
- ~6 months of building/learning
- ~3 months of buffing stuff out and building
	- never stop learning


## Principles/Ideas to Carry Along
- Record everything, sell it too!
- Terminal is your best friend
- AI makes everything fakeable.
	- writing
	- portfolio
	- repos
- AI makes everyone have to wear many hats



# Format for like Check-Ins/Collab
~ 1.5X per week

- Jam Coding problems
	- https://www.hackerrank.com/
- Get feedback
	- You have code committed, add me as a *collaborator*
- "I'm stuck"
	- Jam problems with actual projects
